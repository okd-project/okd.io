We ask that you treat your fellow community members with respect and courtesy.

Repeated bumps or reminders in rapid succession are not good displays of patience. Always wait patiently for a response.</p> </li> <li> <p>Respectful:     Every community inevitably has disagreements, but disagreements are never an excuse for rudeness, hostility, threatening behavior, abuse (verbal or physical), or personal attacks.

Rather than asking whether you can ask a question (the answer is always yes!), simply ask your question. You are encouraged to provide as many specifics as possible. Code snippets in the form of Gists or other paste site links are almost always needed in order to get the most helpful answers. Refrain from pasting multiple lines of code directly into the Google Group channel or emails. Instead use gist.github.com or another paste site to provide code snippets.

Is OKD4 an upstream of OCP?","text":"<p>In 3.x release time OKD was used as an upstream project for Openshift Container Platform. OKD could be installed on Fedora/CentOS/RHEL and used CentOS based images to install the cluster. OCP, however, could be installed only on RHEL and its images were rebuilt to be RHEL-based.</p> <p>Universal Base Image project has enabled us to run RHEL-based images on any platform, so the full image rebuild is no longer necessary, allowing OKD4 project to reuse most images from OCP4. There is another critical part of OCP - Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS. Although RHCOS is an open source project (much like RHEL8) it's not a community-driven project. As a result, OKD workgroup has made a decision to use Fedora CoreOS - open source and community-driven project - as a base for OKD4. This decision allows end-users to modify all parts of the cluster using prepared instructions.</p> <p>It should be noted that OKD4 is being automatically built from OCP4 ci stream, so most of the tests are happening in OCP CI and being mirrored to OKD. As a result, OKD4 CI doesn't have to run a lot of tests to ensure the release is valid.</p> <p>These relationships are more complex than \"upstream/downstream\", so we use \"sibling distributions\" to describe its state.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#how-stable-is-okd4","title":"How stable is OKD4?","text":"<p>OKD4 builds are being automatically tested by release-controller.

As Red Hat engineers working on OpenShift, we have many tools at our disposal to research cluster failures and to report our findings to our colleagues. We would like to share some of our experiences, techniques, and tools with the wider OKD community in the hopes of inspiring others to investigate these areas.</p> <p>As part of our daily activities we spend a significant amount of time investigating bugs, and also failures in our release images and testing systems. As you might imagine, to accomplish this task we use many tools and pieces of tribal knowledge to understand not only the failures themselves, but the complexity of the build and testing infrastructures. As Kubernetes and OpenShift have grown, there has always been an organic growth of tooling and testing that helps to support and drive the development process forward. To fully understand the depths of these processes is to be actively following what is happening with the development cycle. This is not always easy for users who are also focused on delivering high quality service through their clusters.</p> <p>On 2 September, 2022, we had the opportunity to record a video of ourselves diving into the OKD release artifacts to show how we investigate failures in the continuous integration release pipeline. In this video we walk through the process of finding a failing release test, examining the Prow console, and then exploring the results that we find. We explain what these artifacts mean, how to further research failures that are found, and share some other web-based tools that you can use to find similar failures, understand the testing workflow, and ultimately share your findings through a bug report.</p> <p>To accompany the video, here are some of the links that we explore and related content:</p> <ul> <li>www.okd.io/installation/ - the main OKD installation page, where our journey begins</li> <li>amd64.origin.releases.ci.openshift.org/ - OKD releases for AMD64, the place to go for release images and continuous integration reporting</li> <li>docs.prow.k8s.io/docs/overview/architecture/ - an overview of Prow architecture, this is useful to understand how Prow operates</li> <li>github.com/openshift/release - OpenShift and OKD\u2019s Prow configuration, go here to find how the jobs are setup</li> <li>github.com/openshift/origin/ - conformance tests for OpenShift and OKD, this is where many of the Kubernetes tests are located</li> <li>steps.ci.openshift.org/ - CI step registry, useful for discovering how test jobs flow together</li> <li>search.ci.openshift.org/ - CI log search, useful for finding similar test failures</li> <li>docs.ci.openshift.org/docs/ - home of the OpenShift CI docs</li> <li>docs.ci.openshift.org/docs/getting-started/useful-links/ - useful links to various services, also links to talks and presentations</li> <li>docs.ci.openshift.org/docs/how-tos/artifacts/ - explanations of CI artifacts</li> <li>issues.redhat.com - OpenShift/OKD bug reporting system</li> </ul> <p>Finally, if you do find bugs or would like report strange behavior in your clusters, remember to visit issues.redhat.com and use the project OCPBUGS.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2022-10-20-OKD-at-Kubecon-NA-Detroit/","title":"OKD at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2022","text":"<p>by Diane Mueller</p> <p>date: 2022-10-20</p> <p>Are you heading to Kubecon/NA October 24, 2022 - October 28, 2022 in Detroit at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2022?</p> <p>If so, here's where you'll find members of the OKD Working Group and Red Hat engineers that working on delivering the latest releases of OKD at Kubecon!</p>"},{"location":"blog/2022-10-20-OKD-at-Kubecon-NA-Detroit/#october-25th","title":"October 25th","text":"<p>At the OpenShift Commons Gathering on Tuesday, October 25, 2022 | 9:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. EDT, we're hosting an in-person OKD Working Group Lunch &amp; Learn Meet up from 12 noon to 3 pm lead by co-chairs Jaime Magiera (ICPSR at University of Michigan Institute for Social Research), Diane Mueller(Red Hat) and special guests including Michael McCune(Red Hat) in Break-out room D at the Westin Book Cadillac a 10 minute walk from the conference venue. followed by a Lightning Talk: OKD Working Group Update &amp; Road Map on the OpenShift Common main stage at 3:45 pm.

An OKD Stream refers to a build, test, and release pipeline for any configuration of OKD, the open source kubernetes distribution that powers OpenShift. The OKD working group is pleased to announce the availability of tooling and processes that will enable building and testing many configurations, or \"streams\".  The OKD Working Group and Red Hat Engineering are now testing one such stream that runs an upstream version of RHEL9 via CentOS Streams CoreOS (\u2018SCOS\u2019 for short) to improve our RHEL9 readiness signal for Red Hat OpenShift. It is the first of many OKD Streams that will enable developers inside and outside of Red Hat to easily experiment with and explore Cloud Native technologies. You can check out our MVP OKD on SCOS release here.</p> <p>With this initiative, the OKD working group has embraced new patterns and built new partnerships. We have leveraged the concepts in the open source managed service \u2018Operate First\u2019 pattern, worked with the CentOS and CoreOS communities to build a pipeline for building SCOS and applied new CI/CD technologies (Tekton) to build a new OKD release build pipeline service. The MVP of OKD Streams, for example, is an SCOS backed version of OKD built with a Tekton pipeline managed by the OKD working group that runs on AWS infrastructure managed by Operate First. Together we are unlocking some of the innovations to get better (and earlier) release signals for Kubernetes , OCP and RHEL and to enable the OKD community to get more deeply involved with the OKD build processes.</p> <p>The OKD Working group wanted to make participation in all of these activities easier for all Cloud Native developers and this has been the motivating force behind the OKD Streams initiative.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2022-10-25-OKD-Streams-Building-the-Next-Generation-of-OKD-together/#from-the-one-size-fits-all-to-built-to-order","title":"From the \u2018One Size Fits All\u2019 to \u2018Built to Order\u2019","text":"<p>There are main three problems that both the OKD working group and Red Hat Engineering teams spend a lot of time thinking about:</p> <ol> <li>how do we improve our release signals for OpenShift, RHEL, CoreOS</li> <li>how do we get features into the hands of our customer and partners faster</li> <li>how do we enable engineers to experiment and innovate</li> </ol> <p>Previously, what we referred to as an \u2018OKD\u2019 release, was built on the most recent release of OKD running on the latest stable release of Fedora CoreOS (FCOS for short).  In actuality, we had a singular release pipeline that built a release of OKD with a bespoke version of FCOS. These releases of OKD gave us early signals for the impact of new operating system features that would eventually be landing in RHEL, where they will surface in RHEL CoreOS (RHCOS). It was (and still is) a very good way for developers to experiment with OKD and explore its functionality.</p> <p>The OKD community wanted to empower wider use of OKD for experimentation in more use cases that required layering on additional resources in some cases, and in others use cases, reducing the footprints for edge and local deployments. OKD has been stable enough for some to run production deployments. CERN\u2019s OKD deployment on OpenStack, for example, is assembled with custom OKD build pipelines. The feedback from these OKD builds has been a source of inspiration for this OKD Streams initiative to enable more such use cases.</p> <p>The OKD Streams initiative invites more community input and feedback quickly into the project without interrupting the productized builds for OpenShift and OpenShift customers. We can experiment with new features that can then get pushed upstream into Kubernetes or downstream into the OpenShift product. We can reuse the Tekton build pipelines for building streams specific to HPC or Openstack or Bare Metal or whatever the payload customization needs to be for their organizations.</p> <p>Our goal is to make it simple for others to experiment.</p> <p>We are experimenting too. The first OKD Streams \u2018experiment\u2019 built with the new Tekton build pipeline running on an Operate First AWS Cluster is OKD running on SCOS, which is a future version of OpenShift running on a near-future version of RHEL that's leveraging CentOS Streams CoreOS. This will improve our RHEL9 readiness signal for OCP. Improved RHEL9 readiness signals with input from the community will showcase our work as we explore what the new OKD build service is going to mean for all of us.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2022-10-25-OKD-Streams-Building-the-Next-Generation-of-OKD-together/#tekton-pipelines-as-the-building-blocks","title":"Tekton Pipelines as the Building Blocks","text":"<p>Our new OKD Streams are built using Tekton pipelines, which makes it easier for us to explore building many different kinds of pipelines.</p> <p>Tekton is a Continuous Deployment (CD) system that enables us to run tasks and pipelines in a composable and flexible manner.
